Bluetap is a community-driven digital platform designed to address these challenges by improving the management, reporting, and monitoring of shared water resources. The platform enables residents to locate nearby water points, report leaks or breakdowns, and receive real-time updates on water availability. By connecting residents, local water committees, and technicians through a collaborative digital environment, Bluetap promotes accountability, transparency, and efficiency in community water management.

The project leverages modern web and mobile technologies—using Flutter for the frontend, Node.js/Firebase for backend services, and MongoDB/Firebase Firestore for the database layer. The system is designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and easily deployable in diverse community settings. This document provides a detailed overview of the system’s conception, design, architecture, and implementation approach, as well as its anticipated impact on water management practices in Cameroon.

1. Problem Statement

In many Cameroonian communities, particularly in peri-urban and rural areas, access to water is often facilitated through communal sources such as public taps, boreholes, and water tanks. Unfortunately, the management of these shared resources is plagued by numerous issues.

Common problems include:

Unreported leaks and damages leading to water wastage.

Frequent tap closures due to delayed maintenance or mismanagement.

Lack of communication between residents, water committees, and technicians.

Absence of a central reporting system, making problem tracking inefficient.

Conflicts arising among residents over responsibility and usage rights.

Without a coordinated platform to manage and monitor these community resources, the sustainability of water points is severely compromised. Bluetap seeks to bridge this communication gap through a centralized digital system that empowers communities to take an active role in managing their shared water infrastructure.

2. Objectives
General Objective

To design and implement a community-based digital water management system that enables effective monitoring, reporting, and maintenance of shared water points within Cameroonian communities.

Specific Objectives

Develop a cross-platform application for community users and water committees.

Enable users to locate nearby water points and check their operational status.

Facilitate real-time reporting of faults, leaks, or shortages.

Provide an administrative dashboard for water committees to track reports and coordinate maintenance.

Promote community collaboration and transparency in water management.

Ensure scalability and reliability of the system for future expansion.

3. Project Scope

The Bluetap system focuses primarily on community-level water management within Cameroon. It targets neighborhoods or villages with shared taps or boreholes. The platform does not require IoT sensors or physical automation during its initial phase; rather, it relies on user input, community reporting, and digital coordination.

The scope includes:

Design and development of a mobile/web application.

Database design for storing user reports, tap data, and maintenance records.

Integration with map APIs for location-based services.

Implementation of a notification system for status updates.

A web-based admin dashboard for oversight and analytics.

The project does not initially include IoT-based automation, billing systems, or water quality detection, though these may be added in future versions.

4. System Overview

Bluetap is conceptualized as a three-tier distributed system:

Frontend Layer (User Interface): A Flutter-based cross-platform app that runs on mobile and web. It allows users to view, report, and receive updates about water points.

Backend Layer (Business Logic): A Node.js or Firebase Function-based backend that processes data, handles user authentication, and manages requests between users and the database.

Database Layer: A cloud database (Firebase Firestore or MongoDB Atlas) storing persistent data such as user profiles, reports, water point details, and maintenance logs.

Data flows smoothly between the layers, ensuring scalability, concurrency, and data reliability.

5. Key Features

Water Point Locator: Users can view the location and status of community water points on a map.

Real-Time Reporting: Users report leaks, tap closures, or shortages directly via the app.

Community Dashboard: Displays aggregated data, allowing community leaders to monitor performance.

Notifications: Push notifications alert users of changes such as water restoration or scheduled repairs.

Admin Panel: Enables administrators to track and manage reports, assign technicians, and update tap statuses.

Offline Data Caching: Allows basic functionality even with limited internet access.

Analytics and Reports: Generates statistics on reported issues and maintenance efficiency.

6. System Architecture

The Bluetap system is based on a distributed cloud architecture designed for scalability and fault tolerance.

6.1 Architectural Layers

Presentation Layer: Flutter frontend application (mobile/web).

Application Layer: Backend services implemented with Node.js/Express or Firebase Functions.

Data Layer: Cloud-based database (Firestore/MongoDB) for persistence.

API Layer: RESTful or GraphQL APIs handling requests and responses between the client and backend.

6.2 Scalability Design

The system uses horizontal scaling by deploying backend services in cloud environments that support auto-scaling, such as Railway or Firebase Hosting. The database uses partitioning and sharding to ensure smooth performance as data volume increases.

6.3 Fault Tolerance

Bluetap ensures reliability through:

Cloud-based automatic backups.

Stateless backend services to reduce dependency failures.

Retry mechanisms for failed network requests.

Caching for frequently accessed data.

A map view showing active/inactive water points.

A reporting form for users to describe problems.

A notification tab for updates.

A dashboard view for community leaders.

8.2 Backend Design

The backend handles:

CRUD operations for user and tap data.

Authentication and session management.

Real-time synchronization between users and administrators.

RESTful API endpoints for external integrations.

8.3 Database Schema

Main collections/tables:

Users: { user_id, name, role, community, contact }

WaterPoints: { point_id, location, status, description }

Reports: { report_id, user_id, point_id, issue_type, status, timestamp }

Notifications: { notification_id, message, user_group, time_sent }

9. Data Flow and Use Case Diagrams
