# Bluetap — Community Water Management (Distributed Demo)

This repository contains a student project prototype demonstrating a **distributed storage & sync simulation** for the Bluetap community water management system.

## What’s included
- `storage_virtual_node.py` — instructor-provided node simulation (resource tracking, chunked transfers). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- `main.py` — example transfer script showing basic usage. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- `bluetap_demo.py` — automated demo harness with four scenarios (offline queue & sync, geo-latency, failure & failover, node metrics).
- `docs/architecture.md` — explanation of how the simulation maps to Bluetap distributed design.

## How to run (quick)
1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.  
2. Place `storage_virtual_node.py`, `main.py`, and `bluetap_demo.py` in the same folder.  
3. Run demo:
```bash
python bluetap_demo.py
